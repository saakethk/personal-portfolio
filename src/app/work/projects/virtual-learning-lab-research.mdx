## Overview
- **Research project title**: Engineering Blending Drill Games to Facilitate Improved Reading Fluency
- **Research mentor/PI name**: Walter L. Leite, PhD.
- **Institution and department**: Department of Education - Virtual Learning Lab  
- **Start Date**: Sep. 2025

## Research Focus
Blending drills, such as
word chairs and ladders, are commonly used by teachers in the classroom to develop automaticity of
decoding phonemes. This project aims to develop blending drill games that can be implemented in
digital reading tools, such as the Storiza reading app created by my lab. By making these games, we
will investigate fundamental principles for educational game development for young learners.

## Project Responsibilities
I will contribute by prototyping games using Figma, writing back-end code using Python,
front-end code using JavaScript, and React. I will also contribute to summarizing the literature on
digital educational games, conducting user experience research, writing the study results, and
presenting the academic paper.
